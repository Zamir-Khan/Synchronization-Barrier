# Process Synchronization Barrier Project

Welcome to the Process Synchronization Barrier project developed for the Operating System Concepts course in Summer 2023. This project revolves around the implementation of a process synchronization barrier using the power of Semaphores. The goal is to orchestrate a seamless synchronization mechanism that enhances coordination among processes. The barrier is carefully designed to ensure compatibility across diverse platforms while optimizing its performance.

## Features

- Synchronization Barrier: The core feature of this project is the process synchronization barrier. It effectively ensures that multiple processes reach a designated point together before proceeding, improving overall synchronization and coordination.

- Utilization of Semaphores: Semaphores, a key synchronization primitive, are utilized to implement the synchronization barrier. This demonstrates an understanding of advanced synchronization mechanisms.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: The barrier is tailored to work consistently across diverse platforms, showcasing the ability to design robust and adaptable solutions.

## Project Details

### Integration of Process Synchronization Barrier

The project involves the integration of a process synchronization barrier using Semaphores. This barrier ensures that multiple processes pause and wait until all processes have reached the barrier before any of them proceed. This mechanism is particularly useful in scenarios where inter-process coordination is crucial.

### Optimization for Compatibility

One of the significant achievements of the project is optimizing the synchronization barrier for compatibility across various platforms. This ensures that the barrier functions reliably and consistently regardless of the underlying operating system or environment.

### Expertise in C++ Programming and UNIX Environments

The project underscores the developer's expertise in C++ programming and their adeptness in navigating UNIX environments. This includes knowledge of system calls, process management, and utilizing synchronization primitives.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Compile the source code files using a C++ compiler compatible with UNIX environments. There is a Makefile available as well in the src folder.

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable. The program will demonstrate the functionality of the process synchronization barrier by calculating Prefix-sum. 

## Files

- `barrier.cpp`: This is the main source code file that contains the implementation of the process synchronization barrier using Semaphores.
